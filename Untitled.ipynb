      "the middle kingdom of egypt -LRB- also known as the period of reunification -RRB- is the period in the history of ancient egypt between circa 2050 bc and 1710 bc , stretching from the reunification of egypt under the impulse of mentuhotep ii of the eleventh dynasty to the end of the twelfth dynasty .\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "towards the end of this period , two rival dynasties , known in egyptology as the tenth and eleventh , fought for power over the entire country .\n",

      "the theban 11th dynasty only ruled southern egypt from the first cataract to the tenth nome of upper egypt .\n",

      "to the north , lower egypt was ruled by the rival 10th dynasty from herakleopolis .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the struggle was to be concluded by mentuhotep ii , who ascended the theban throne in 2055 b.c .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "during mentuhotep ii 's fourteenth regnal year , he took advantage of a revolt in the thinite nome to launch an attack on herakleopolis , which met little resistance .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "after toppling the last rulers of the 10th dynasty , mentuhotep began consolidating his power over all egypt , a process which he finished by his 39th regnal year .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "to consolidate his authority , he restored the cult of the ruler , depicting himself as a god in his own lifetime , wearing the headdresses of amun and min he died after a reign of 51 years , and passed the throne to his son , mentuhotep iii.mentuhotep iii reigned for only twelve years , during which he continued consolidating theban rule over the whole of egypt , building a series of forts in the eastern delta region to secure egypt against threats from asia .\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "however , the middle kingdom was basically defensive in its military strategy , with fortifications built at the first cataract of the nile , in the delta and across the sinai isthmus.early in his reign , amenemhet i was compelled to campaign in the delta region , which had not received as much attention as upper egypt during the 11th dynasty .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the location of this capital is unknown , but is presumably near the city 's necropolis , the present-day el-lisht .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "this gave the middle kingdom a more feudal organization than egypt had before or would have afterward.in his 20th regnal year , amenemhat established his son senusret i as his coregent , establishing a practice which would be used repeatedly throughout the rest of the middle kingdom and again during the new .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "in amenemhet 's 30th regnal year , he was presumably murdered in a palace conspiracy .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "in his 33rd regnal year , he appointed his son senusret ii coregent.evidence for military activity of any kind during the reign of senusret ii is non-existent .\n",

      "he reigned only fifteen years , which is evidenced by the incomplete nature of many of his constructions .\n",

      "in his sixth year , he re-dredged an old kingdom canal around the first cataract to facilitate travel to upper nubia .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "he used this to launch a series of brutal campaigns in nubia in his sixth , eighth , tenth , and sixteenth years .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "after this , senusret sent one more campaign in his 19th year , but turned back due to abnormally low nile levels , which endangered his ships .\n",

      "egypt was divided into three waret , or administrative divisions : north , south , and head of the south -LRB- perhaps lower egypt , most of upper egypt , and the nomes of the original theban kingdom during the war with herakleopolis , respectively -RRB- .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "his son amenemhet iii began reigning after senusret 's 19th regnal year , which has been widely considered senusret 's highest attested date .\n",

      "however , a reference to a year 39 on a fragment found in the construction debris of senusret 's mortuary temple has suggested the possibility of a long coregency with his son.the reign of amenemhat iii was the height of middle kingdom economic prosperity .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "at some point during the 13th dynasty , xois and avaris began governing themselves , the rulers of xois being the fourteenth dynasty , and the asiatic rulers of avaris being the hyksos of the fifteenth dynasty .\n",

      "by the end of the first intermediate period , some nomarchs ruled their nomes as minor potentates , such as the nomarch nehry of hermopolis , who dated inscriptions by his own regnal year.when the eleventh dynasty came to power , it was necessary to subdue the power of the nomarchs if egypt was to be reunified under a central government .\n",

      "\n",
      "this trend appears to have been reversed during the early years of the middle kingdom , with relatively high water levels recorded for much of this era , with an average inundation of 19 meters above its non-flood levels .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the years of repeated high inundation levels correspond to the most prosperous period of the middle kingdom , which occurred during the reign of amenemhat iii .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "this seems to be confirmed in some of the literature of the period , such as in the instructions of amenemhat , where the king tells his son how agriculture prospered under his reign.artone of the innovations in sculpture that occurred during the middle kingdom was the block statue , which would continue to be popular through to the ptolemaic age almost 2,000 years later .\n",
